# Project Cost and Timeline Estimation

## Timeline

The projected timeline for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is **4 months**.

*   **Month 1:** Project Setup, UI/UX Design, and Prototyping
*   **Month 2:** Frontend and Backend Development (User Management, Job Posting)
*   **Month 3:** Continued Development and Integration (Messaging, Payments)
*   **Month 4:** Testing, Deployment, and Launch

## Cost Estimation

The estimated cost for the MVP development is broken down as follows. This assumes a team of 1 Project Manager, 2 Frontend Developers, 2 Backend Developers, 1 UI/UX Designer, and 1 QA Engineer.

*   **MVP Development (4 months):** Approximately **$200,000 - $250,000**
*   **Monthly Post-Launch Maintenance & Feature Development:** Approximately **$20,000 - $30,000**
*   **Infrastructure and Third-Party Services (Monthly):** Approximately **$1,000 - $2,000**

**Note:** These are high-level estimates. A detailed breakdown would require a more in-depth analysis of the feature requirements and local market rates for talent.
